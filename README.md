# FreeCodeCamp-Challenge | Basic Front End Development Project

# Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage 

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
